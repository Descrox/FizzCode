# Fizz
Fizz is a programming language compiled using Java. It's a small project I've been working on for a while now, occasionally
rebuilding from the ground up when I feel confident enough that I can make it more efficient. Right now the project isn't
much, but eventually I plan on making a language which will be worthy of consideration for use.
